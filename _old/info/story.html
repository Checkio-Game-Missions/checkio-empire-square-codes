    <p>The door of the pyramid rumbled and shook itself open. Inside the door was what appeared to be another wall.</p>

    <p>“Oh man, that’s not very interesting at all.” Sofia complained.</p>

    <p>The wall within the door hissed and a jet of ice cold steam billowed out. The wall began moving out the door as
        if it were being pushed. Sofia and the other two stepped back, watching their feet. The wall finally stopped
        moving and revealed itself to be a large chest of some sort. </p>

    <p>“Oh man, more treasure?” Sofia studied the chest intently.</p>

    <p>Nikola poked his head through the doorway where the chest had just exited. “Well, there’s nothing in there but
        darkness.” He turned to the chest which stood several feet taller than him and began studying it himself. He
        noticed some carvings on the side. “Hey, this looks like a manifest of some sort. Or a contents label. Look,
        there Ag, Na, Li, Mg... all raw materials we could use to fabricate the parts we need to fix the Oddyseus!”</p>

    <p>“That’s great, but there’s a keypad on it. It’s locked.” Sofia said with a frustrated sigh.</p>

    <p>“No problem, we can solve it. Let’s take a look!”</p>
